next improvement of the prediction model :

        - try to use the next day prediction to simulate the next 10 days prediction by reuse the predicted data
        - change the date and the time to predict for example the next 10 hours
        - try to add trading information like MMA, MME, RSI... in order that the prediction is not only based on the close price

best way to improve is using SVM algorithms but not KNN and implied Volume and volatility
